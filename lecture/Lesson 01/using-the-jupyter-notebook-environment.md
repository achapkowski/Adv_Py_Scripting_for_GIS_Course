# Using the Jupyter Notebook environment

This section provides a quick introduction to the Jupyter Notebook environment where you can run Python code in an interactive manner and visualize the output as maps and charts.  Refer to the [official Jupyter documentation](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [this quick start guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for further details.

## Starting the Jupyter Notebook environment

Once ArcGIS Pro, you can start the Jupyter Notebook environment by typing the following command in your terminal.

    jupyter notebook

If you are running a Windows OS, this could be your command prompt or PowerShell window. Similarly if you are running a Mac or Linux OS, this could be your terminal. Below is a screen shot of how it would appear if you were running the command from Windows command prompt.

The page you see in this image is called the Notebook Dashboard.

## Creating new notebooks

In addition to running the sample notebooks, you can create new notebooks for your projects. To do so, from the Notebook Dashboard page, click on the 'New' button and select a Python kernel of choice as shown in the image below.

Alternately, you can create new notebooks from the 'File' menu of a running notebook. In the screenshot above, note the icons of currently running notebooks are green in color.

## Further help and keyboard shortcuts

You can get a tour of the notebook interface from the `Help -> User Interface Tour` menu. As you get used to this new interface, you can enhance your productivity by learning a few keyboard shortcuts. Accessing `Help > Keyboard shortcuts` from a running notebook will bring up a help dialog as shown below.

Among the shortcuts, `ctrl + shift + P` or `cmd + shift + P` on a mac is particularly useful as it brings up a command palette into which you can type what you wish to do and execute it. Refer to this blog article [Five tips to get you started with Jupyter notebooks](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2017/06/30/82220/) to get further understanding on patterns to follow while using Jupyter notebooks.
