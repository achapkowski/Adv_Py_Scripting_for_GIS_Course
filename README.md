## Course Description


This course focuses on advanced uses of Python as a scripting tool to automate workflows in GIS and create customized applications. This includes the development of script tools, utilizing advanced ArcPy modules, working with third-party modules, customizing GIS applications, and more advanced Python functionality. Offered once a year. Prerequisites: 430.606 Programming in GIS.

----------------------
## Course Goal


The goal is that each week there will be a geospatial concept along with a fundamental programming concept so students learn both foundational and geospatial programming skills.

---------------------
## Course Objectives
- Learn Python and understand how to use it to solve geospatial problems
- Encourage the use of Python through relevant examples and assignments
- Encourage students implementing it in their own research projects using geospatial technologies.
